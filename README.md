# Spotifube

> A `GUI` for the [@ritiek]()'s [`spotify-downloader`](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader/) project.

## What is spotify-downloader?
`spotify-downloader` is a CLI that uses Spotify tracks/playlists to match youtube videos and download them as mp3, including id3, album art, etc.

## Why Spotifube?
Spotifube will provide initially (MVP) a simple UI to drag and drop playlist links, fetch the tracks inside of these playlists and provide a way to the user download these songs into a folder.

## Getting Started
